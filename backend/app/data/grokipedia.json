These processes include learning (the acquisition of information and rules for using the information), reasoning (using rules to reach approximate or definite conclusions), and self-correction. AI applications include expert systems, natural language processing, speech recognition, and machine vision.",

    "content": "Machine Learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. ML focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it to learn for themselves. The process of learning begins with observations or data, such as examples, direct experience, or instruction, in order to look for patterns in data and make better decisions in the future.",

For example, in image processing, lower layers may identify edges, while higher layers may identify concepts relevant to a human such as digits, letters, or faces. Deep learning has been particularly successful in areas like computer vision, natural language processing, and speech recognition.",
