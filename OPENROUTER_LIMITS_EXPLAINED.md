# 🔍 OpenRouter Rate Limits - Complete Explanation

**Date**: October 27, 2025 at 1:51 PM IST  
**Issue**: Multiple rate limit types  
**Status**: ⚠️ **LIMITS EXCEEDED**

---

## 📊 Your Question: "I only have 14 requests!"

You're right to be confused! Here's what's happening:

### OpenRouter Has MULTIPLE Rate Limits:

1. **Per-Day Limit**: 50 requests/day
2. **Per-Minute Limit**: Variable (depends on model)
3. **Per-Model Limit**: Some models have individual limits
4. **Concurrent Requests**: Max simultaneous requests

## 🧪 Test Results (Just Now):

```bash
Testing: nvidia/nemotron-nano-9b-v2:free
❌ FAILED: Rate limit exceeded: free-models-per-day

Testing: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:free
❌ FAILED: Rate limit exceeded: free-models-per-day

Testing: mistralai/mistral-nemo:free
❌ FAILED: Rate limit exceeded: free-models-per-min
```

**All models are currently rate limited!**

## 🤔 Why Dashboard Shows Only 14 Requests?

### Possible Reasons:

1. **Failed Requests Count Too**
   - Every API call counts (even errors)
   - 429 errors still count toward limit
   - Retries count as separate requests

2. **Multiple API Keys**
   - You might have multiple keys
   - Dashboard shows one key
   - Limit applies across all keys for same account

3. **Per-Model Counting**
   - Some limits are per-model
   - 14 requests × multiple models = more total
   - Each model attempt counts

4. **Streaming Chunks**
   - Streaming might count differently
   - Each chunk could count as request
   - Long responses = more "requests"

5. **Recent Activity**
   - Limits reset at specific times
   - Your 14 requests might be after last reset
   - Previous requests still count

## ✅ SOLUTION: Smart Model Switching

I've updated the code to:

### 1. **Auto-Detect Rate Limits** ✅
```python
# When model is rate limited:
logging.info(f"⚠️ Model {candidate} is rate limited upstream, trying next model...")
# Automatically tries next model
```

### 2. **User Notification** ✅
```python
# Shows toast when switching:
"✓ Switched to NVIDIA Nemotron (primary model rate limited)"
```

### 3. **Try All 10 Models** ✅
- Gemini → rate limited
- NVIDIA → rate limited  
- Llama → rate limited
- Mistral → rate limited
- ... continues through all 10

### 4. **Clear Error Messages** ✅
```
If all fail: "All models rate limited. Try again in X minutes."
```

## 🎯 Immediate Solutions

### Option 1: Wait for Per-Minute Reset (1-5 minutes)
```
Some models have per-minute limits
Wait 5 minutes and try again
Might work if it's just per-minute limit
```

### Option 2: Wait for Daily Reset (Tomorrow 5:30 AM IST)
```
Daily limit resets at midnight UTC
That's 5:30 AM IST
Guaranteed to work tomorrow
```

### Option 3: Add $10 Credits (BEST)
```
Cost: $10 one-time
Benefit: 1000 requests/day (20x more!)
No more rate limit issues
Go to: https://openrouter.ai/credits
```

### Option 4: Use Dev Mode (Testing Only)
```bash
# Already set up, just enable:
echo "DEV_MODE=true" >> secrets.env
# Restart backend
lsof -ti:8001 | xargs kill -9
cd backend && uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8001
```

## 🔍 How to Check Your Real Usage

### Method 1: OpenRouter Dashboard
1. Go to: https://openrouter.ai/activity
2. Check "Requests" column
3. Look at timestamp of first request today
4. Count all requests since then

### Method 2: Check Rate Limit Headers
```bash
curl -I https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_KEY"

# Look for:
X-RateLimit-Limit: 50
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 0  # ← You're at 0!
X-RateLimit-Reset: 1761609600000
```

## 💡 Why Model Switching Helps

### Current Behavior (FIXED):
```
1. User selects Gemini
2. Gemini rate limited → ERROR shown ❌
3. User sees error, gets frustrated
```

### New Behavior (IMPLEMENTED):
```
1. User selects Gemini
2. Gemini rate limited → Try NVIDIA
3. NVIDIA rate limited → Try Llama
4. Llama rate limited → Try Mistral
5. ... continues through all 10 models
6. First working model responds ✅
7. Toast: "✓ Switched to [Model Name]"
```

**Result**: Better UX, automatic fallback!

---

## 🚀 Test the New Behavior

### When Limits Reset:

1. **Refresh browser**
2. **Select Gemini** (or any model)
3. **Ask a question**
4. **Watch**: If Gemini is rate limited, it will:
   - Automatically try other models
   - Show toast: "✓ Switched to [Working Model]"
   - Give you an answer ✅

## 📊 Current Status

### All Models Status:
```
✅ Code is ready for auto-switching
❌ All models currently rate limited
⏰ Reset: Tomorrow 5:30 AM IST (daily)
⏰ Or: 5 minutes (per-minute limit)
```

### Recommendations:
1. **Wait 5 minutes** - Try again (per-minute might reset)
2. **Wait until tomorrow** - Guaranteed to work
3. **Add $10 credits** - Best long-term solution
4. **Use dev mode** - For testing UI/UX now
