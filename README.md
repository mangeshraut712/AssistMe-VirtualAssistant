# AssistMe-Virtual-Assistant
AssistMe is a virtual assistant web app developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It performs tasks like displaying current time, providing simulated weather updates, telling random jokes, opening popular websites, and answering general questions using Wikipedia knowledge. It incorporates command parsing with JavaScript conditionals, utilizes the fetch API for asynchronous data retrieval, and employs DOM manipulation for dynamic responses. The project enhances skills in API integration, front-end scripting, and building interactive web interfaces without requiring paid API keys.
